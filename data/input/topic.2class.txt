640523838321725444	nintendo	positive	@ZeroSHEARER @ZhugeEX again an improvement. I don't like barely any Nintendo first party exclusives. It's ALL about 3rd party on all systems
640624064198017024	nintendo	positive	@THEREALRTU but then I suppose the 3rd party ports suffer ,maybe Nintendo will use nvidia for there gfx chip... Lol

641295492492738560	nintendo	positive	@JediPrince84 I bought Rayman Legends just to have some simple fun. I can't wait for Nintendo to sink and become a 2nd/3rd party developer
641296016788996096	nintendo	positive	It would be poetic if Nintendo became a Sony 2nd Party Developer. It would also make choosing consoles every generation very easy

635513280988061696	federer	positive	Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
635513486479650816	federer	positive	Federer will be 2nd seed at @usopen if he wins this. Djokovic aiming to become 1st player to win all 9 Masters 1000 tournaments #CincyTennis

636936698144821248	federer	positive	@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
637082749875134464	federer	positive	All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
637492541969928192	federer	positive	@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
637701377205121025	federer	positive	Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time.

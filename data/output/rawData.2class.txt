Well, after more than 2 years I just got a copyright notice from Nintendo on my 2nd oldest video. The culprit? The Wind Waker's main theme.
@Beemercanada Let's make him more likely to be confirmed  #Isaac4Smash #Isaac4Smash! #ISAAC4SMASH! C'mon, Nintendo, this is our childhoods!
@Bendilin @TheFrenchCritic With Nintendo's policy on their flagship exclusives? There are better odds of the sun going supernova in 10 secs.
1st party Nintendo games stay stupidly expensive. Why is Mario Party 9 still $44.99 most places? Definitely not the "QUALITY" of the titles.
@DanteReborn I honestly think the Super Mario Bros 2 set is coming. Nintendo wanted to concentrate development on the more-similar sets 1st

@jrconway3 @BitnerdGX Sure, it may not be in a direct sense. But Nintendo gives GX the support by sending them coverage and press releases.
I admit Nintendo may have gone a bit overboard with the whole "lets give all the popular youtubers a copy of super mario maker" thing
@xchadillacx it comes out NOV 13 if it does come out.  Nintendo is notorious for rumors trust me ha
I find it interesting that 3rd party collector's edition don't sell out. Nintendo is a different story.
Just updated my profile to help promote the new game for the Nintendo 3DS coming out on September 25 called Animal Crossing Happy Homes!
i dont know is that the nintendo direct tomorrow is probably when were going to get right
@Warpjump @NinBendo1 At least it established that Nintendo can put in 3rd party characters. (I want Snake back)
Tomorrow's Nintendo Know is all done and it's going to be a pretty good time. http://t.co/WxAxUzhgcy
There is a certain cult classic game, the 3rd in its series, that we have been waiting for in the US but Nintendo refuses to release it
Honestly, lack of 3rd party support should have been expected. its not the company's fault for not siding with Nintendo
@ZeroSHEARER @ZhugeEX again an improvement. I don't like barely any Nintendo first party exclusives. It's ALL about 3rd party on all systems
@THEREALRTU but then I suppose the 3rd party ports suffer ,maybe Nintendo will use nvidia for there gfx chip... Lol
@16KTS @Flareonys Nintendo needs some more 3rd party reps, but at the same time that's what makes them pure.
On November 18th 1998, Nintendo released the Game Boy Color. The first handheld allowed to be owned by POC. #BullshitHistory

@LeafyCam @Valhalla_Nights Nintendo should just pack it up and go 3rd party if its not at LEAST 4.
@Gary_BBGames Where did you order it from? Tell me it was the Nintendo store so I can hope it turns up tomorrow.
My long shot dream announcement tomorrow from Apple: Apple TV video games include a partnership with Nintendo.
@BlazeRuler Nintendo may have wanted to make it E10+, so they left him out. I dunno, probably not true
@JediPrince84 I bought Rayman Legends just to have some simple fun. I can't wait for Nintendo to sink and become a 2nd/3rd party developer
It would be poetic if Nintendo became a Sony 2nd Party Developer. It would also make choosing consoles every generation very easy
Apparently Super Mario Maker comes out on the 11th of September. I guess it's Nintendo's way of saying "just bloody rebuild them already".
What if tomorrow Apple is just like, "the Apple TV is now a game console and we're going to take on Sony and Microsoft (and Nintendo)" lol.
@wanlov may your everyday look like bonus points you get while playing one of those Nintendo game of Super Mario
Out of all of the Nintendo franchises, I wish I could be excited for Pikman 4. C'mon, can't I just have Star Tropics 3?

Odd because Cena and Nikki were seen laughing with Ric Flair Saturday or Sunday. https://t.co/b8NpoeiHMr
Ric Flair is going to be at Sidebar on Friday. I must go.
I hope that when @RonFunches wins @midnight for the 16th time, Ric Flair comes out to congratulate him. Unless Jon Stewart interferes.
I just took a Coach Freeze clip out of the new @HeadtoHeadRadio intro, to make room for Ric Flair. I love my job. New intro debuts tomorrow!
@LaurenceWHolmes What do you mean, Laurence? The Dudleys, Ric Flair, and Sting were on Raw Monday. Taker wrestled Sunday. It IS the 90s.
If @MsCharlotteWWE defeats Nikki Bella at #nightofchampions, it Should be similar to how Ric Flair beat Dusty Rhodes to win his 1st title
22 years ago I saw Ric Flair wrestle at age 3, in the very building I'll see @MsCharlotteWWE wrestle in tomorrow night. Mindblowing!!
@PocketVolcano I take it you heard Ric Flair is at Dreamwave in Jan 1/2/16
Rick Perry was going to go on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? to win money to continue his campaign, but he's embarrassed himself enough.
Gotta love the Rick Perry delusion ... God has tricked 'Tricky Ricky'. https://t.co/Q36Zo6pHPj
Rick Perry has stopped paying staff &amp; rumors of Rand Paul implosion are everywhere. Are these the 1st 2 out?
Looks like Rick Perry may be the first out in the #GOP race.  He's out of money already!
Rick Perry may be the first to drop out. Out of money.  http://t.co/zwmnwXbH0J #GOP2016
I think a big part of Rick Perry's fall is simply that he is not a sitting governor this time around. May be Jeb's downfall too.
Rick Perry may have to drop out of the race, before one vote is cast, because he has run out of money. I have mixed feelings about that.
@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump -How could anyone (Other than Megyn Kelly) compare Rick Perry with Trump? C'mon. Perry is a joke.
May be Rick Perry wishes he would have answered question he was asked 5 times in 24 hours on fox what would u do with 11 million illegals?
Rick Perry said he was the Zar of stopping illegals sat there and glossed himself for 2 months how he could secure the border not 1 idea11 m
Personally, I like Rick Perry and appreciate what he did for Texas. But as president...dunno. He may start a war by mispronouncing something

Scott Walker is getting so desperate, we may just see him borrowing Rick Perry's black frame eyeglasses.
@iowahawkblog @jpodhoretz I went to Texas A&amp;M but oddly never met Rick Perry.  I think he may have spent that year in Pakistan.

Best part about following Sarah Palin on twitter is, no matter how much you double check, you always think it may be a parody account...
Sarah Palin may be the only reporter Donald Trump wants to have on his campaign bus because she asks only questions Trump needs her to ask.
I swear watching that interview just made me wanna throw Sarah Palin and Trump in a rocket to the sun
@EmaSlema  Q: What's the difference between Sarah Palin and Donald Trump? A: Lipstick You may be too young to get that
When Sarah Palin and Donald Trump speak for America, I think it may be time for a new revolution.
Sarah Palin's brain aged like a tub of sour cream left in the sun.
Sarah Palin being chosen as Donald Trump's running mate or chief promoter may be the last thing that could ever surprise folks!

Pls CNN why in a world u bring this idiot Sarah Palin on Sunday great news program state of the Union CNN u really fuck up my Sunday

@CNN - When you waste Sunday pretending Sarah Palin or her opinions are relevant you just admit that you've given up on being a news source.
I think Sarah Palin may have a health issue . I had a hyper - active thyroid and I still can't remember all of the odd things I said &amp; did.
Watching Sarah Palin telling people to speak "American" was the highlight of my Sunday. That was some classic self destruction.

We need to thank the Left for making Gov. Sarah Palin trend ALL DAY on the Sunday before Labor Day on Twitter. Thanks guys.
Shouldn't Sarah Palin be putting her  little mind onto maters such as 'who is the baby daddy for my 4th grandbaby??

@PoliticalLaughs @kesgardner Besides I don't believe that SCOTUS has the power to overturn state marriage laws per the 10th amendment
@Yowan @EyeAmSMF  However, I don't think today's SCOTUS and Fed Govt would interpret the 9th that way.  9th &amp;10th have seemingly disappeared
@aquapub I know I'm stupid but it seems SCOTUS has established marriage as a right via 14th. Kim was denying people who legally qualified.

@rbassilian @souperfan2013  Actually there were many laws passed by many people in the states, SCOTUS just ignored the 10th Amendment
@jspoupart @JoeC1776 no. Congress makes laws and the SCOTUS settles disputes. In this case, the 1st Amendment lost.
@pnkust @USSupremeCourt Here, this will explain SCOTUS decision on SS marriage as it applied it to 14th Amend.  http://t.co/WqHlbCq9wS
Suggestion - get familiar with 1ST Amendment.  it pretty much strikes down all SCOTUS rulings regarding gay marriage, holiday celebrations
@littlebytesnews I never said it is. But the SCOTUS ruled that the 14th Amendment requires a state to license a marriage of same sex couples
@politibunny @brakinggnus @dangoddu @jbryant710 SCOTUS violated the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution not allowing #KimDavis #1A right
@israel4911 @Letha_Hughes It was the 14th that SCOTUS ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality. News not your strong subject.
@GuyScott33 14TH AMENDMENT guarantees EQUAL PROTECTION so yeah. Oh &amp;, P.S., no, SCOTUS didn't write the law but DID correctly interpret it.
@LeeAdams_4Him purpose of the SCOTUS is to establish constitutionality of laws. they ruled that gay marriage bans violated 14th amend rights
@A10Jim @ninaland @WoodhullSFA And that's why SCOTUS has the last word on what laws states may enact and enforce. Hence "Supreme Court."
.@tonyortegamusic @MagDods @rachelheldevans SCOTUS ruled that the 14th amendment applies to same sex marriage.
The SCOTUS claimed under the 14th amendment they could make the same sex marriage ruling. No matter how far you stretch it isn't there.
@Billd111 @megynkelly @tedcruz SCOTUS has determined that the 14th amendment guarantees equal access to marriage for all citizens
@SniffJenkum SCOTUS has no authority to make law. Only Congress may legislate. #SeparationOfPowers #AbuseOfPower
@cspanwj In their recent pro gay marriage decision, SCOTUS has directly violated 9th and 10th amendments of the United States Constitution.
Clerk #KimDavis is jailed because SCOTUS can see Gay Marriage in the 14th Amend. but Fed.Dist.Judge can't see religious freedom in the 1st.
1A: Congress can't make law preventing religious freedom, so SCOTUS interpretation unlawful Const Trumps case law https://t.co/f4LSUd5ENR
@Lrihendry @ChristieC733 what's scary is that it was only 5-4. Like our SCOTUS, Irving may flip on one vote.
@tedcruz our 14th amendment is also under attack, which one do we chose? oh yeah it's up to SCOTUS and they ruled!
Searching for marriage in the 14th Amendment; how SCOTUS usurp powers that it does not have under the Constitution. https://t.co/jFh4Hd6fYe
@angiezwick which was declared unconstitutional by SCOTUS as a violation of the 14th Amendment...so that's been settled.
@chrisbraly  SCOTUS never made law they interpreted it. 14th A guarantees equal rights for all Americans
@StoneColdChik the panthers are advocating the killing of police, SCOTUS says that "true threats are outside the 1st Amendment so why aren't
@AlphaKruse @suz123nj @papalputz @OtterDose @MatStaver SCOTUS vitiated KY marriage law immediately b/c it violated 14th Amendment
@LarryOConnor @GretchenCarlson U sound like the hated "smartset" now? Is #KimDavis the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from SCOTUS in history?
Huckabee claims SCOTUS made new law on SSM. No. The equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment is more than a century old.
SCOTUS cannot make law only rule on it. Get real America.  Unless it's healthcare.Then they feel they can.    https://t.co/IyMH2Hbe09
SCOTUS Apparently is Saying That Gays Have an Equal Right to Marriage Under the 14th Amendment.
Ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman, if SCOTUS now writes law, guess Ohio has no law and you may marry who/what you wish.
@judgealexferrer I may have missed it if u posted it but what's ur take on #KimDavis situation &amp; @GovMikeHuckabee claims about SCOTUS ruling
@Israeli_Queen You are aware that SCOTUS said that it fell under two sections of the 14th Admendment right?

Interested to see what kind of ratings the U.S. Open final gets on Saturday with Serena presumably going for history up against CFB.
I'm pretty sure Serena ripped that match winning ace the same time USMNT game up their 3rd.
And with Serena's 11th ace she wins the match vs her sister Venus
History still in the making with Serena's win over sister Venus! #GrandSlam https://t.co/p56xxav8vv

Serena reaches her 7th semifinals of the #USOpen in a row. Two more matches to complete the Grand Slam.
@hbryant42 Venus missed so many neutral shots in 3rd set that she never let Serena feel the pressure; she let her off the hook, in a way.
Serena won, but big sister Venus gave her the flux! Congrats to both of them for giving us a great tennis match. https://t.co/brJ29dzm2X

Know what's scary? Serena was mildly injured a little after Wimbledon and sat out before the US Open.  She could win with that formula.
@NerdyWonka @terri_georgia My feeling Serena could win 2 straight set, but as a respect2 Venus and viewers she let Venus 2win 2nd set

If Sting is on RAW tomorrow then there is no doubt he will confront The Undertaker to build towards a match at WrestleMania.
@lentzadam533 yea definitely but I just saw a report that Sting is coming to RAW tomorrow and Taker going be at raw could be interesting
Rumor has it that Sting will appear on #RAW tomorrow night.
@Danielmmafan Sting could always have another match before. I just read hes gonna be on Raw tomorrow.
@FredRichani If you wanna do Rock vs Brock and Taker vs Sting at wm 32. Survivor Series on his 25th anniversary would be the place to end it

And it all ends,  with Sting! Monday Night Raw, was absolutely, WAY more better, then Summerslam. #StingVsRollins  #RawBrooklyn
Including his TNA title wins, Sting is a 14-time World Champion. Beating Seth would tie him with Cena for 2nd of all time. @wwe #raw
great RAW tonight...1st the Dudley Boys and then to end with Sting!!!   #WWERaw #WWE
@DukesWrestling if Sting is in a Rollins story line who's the next rumored 3rd man for Reigns/Ambrose?
Sting winning at #NightOfChampions results in either Sting vs Taker at Mania or Sting vs Cena and I've got a bad feeling it's the 2nd option
Sting is back, and the Dudleys return :D Quite an eventful Monday Night Raw on the whole. Lesnar-Dallas though X'D #RawBrooklyn
@ryan24672 @CMPuLs3 And it'd work, Seth getting the rub and being Sting's 2nd ever opponent + a month long reign with both titles is BIG
@Chrissie32NY so tomorrow we should try &amp; plan a trip to see the next PPV as Sting might be world champ!!
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/zDth0kovNW Seth Rollins vs Sting the Returns 2015 WWE Raw, Aug 24

HERE WE GO Monday Night Raw hopefully we get another good show tonight Sting vs Rollins at NOC should be really good #RAW
I know Sting says this is Monday Night #Raw, but it feels a lot more like Monday Nitro to me
Even if it's an announced segment, I still mark out when Sting is on my TV on Monday nights. #RAW
And @TripleH may have " hand picked " @WWERollins but @StephMcMahon and Sting is right- Rollins is not half the man HHH is. #RAW
Going on record, Sting wins belt at NoC, drops it at the MSG show on the 3rd. If I'm wrong, ya can have open season on me.

Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation: I really tried, you guys, but I can only like Tom Cruise once per decade and Edge of Tomorrow was SO GOOD.
may i just say that Tom Cruise looks hot as fuck in a navy blue suit
Can't wait for The Edge of the Day After Tomorrow, where Tom Cruise gets cold over and over again until he brings down the oil companies.

Trump has a strategy &amp; it's working. "The White Vote: The Rise of Donald Trump Shows It May Be Returning http://t.co/3C3vftEPZP via @usnews"

Do you know Hotels are 17th biggest business in America? Trump is 22nd largest hotel chain in America. In other words a Pipsqueak.
"I would vote for trump tomorrow because that's funny" yeah you and a million other idiots @MrMikeCalta funny doesn't fix shit.
Idk how I feel about going to darts every Wednesday. Like I'm pretty sure every person there for darts is voting for Trump, but idk.
Why many conservative pundits  R declaring war on Trump. Dec- laring war on the most candid &amp;  'for the people' candidate in  YOUR lifetime!
Then your boy Trump must REALLY piss you off, because he wants it too. But yeah, make America great. And stuff. https://t.co/ARQKwSlEMG
Hahaha. Brilliant. Go watch this. BTW, we totally deserve this for unleashing Trump on the world. https://t.co/ukWKqOxhit
@realDonaldTrump @CNN Match the contribution Trump! That'll really show you care, this may come off as a point grab and turn negative.
@matt_mcnult My honest hope right now is that Trump will not receive the GOP nomination and run 3rd party, splitting the GOP vote causing
republicans should check 1st before using songs for their rallies. EyeoftheTiger+Kim Davis=ABSOLUTELY NOT. Same with Trump. #KimDavis
so folks, Trump has now lead consistently nationally and in every key state since beginning of july.  past history shows that wins it all.
As much as I hate to admit, Trump may be right. But he should add #msnbc #foxnews and others into the mix, also. https://t.co/3oQKjV9P4F
@BretBaier @GovChristie @FoxNews I see grit &amp; fight in you 2nd to Trump. If you were front runner how would you handle the PC media atrack?
I may not like Carson, but I'm going to feel genuinely bad about Trump's mouth-breather following going after him https://t.co/iOwB2DxcP2
Trump is really a presidential candidate....this is not the longest MTV Awards skit, nor Saturday Night Live or Living Color. No, really.
This is so important. Trump is playing on the racist fears of white Americans and it's working. https://t.co/UyYAWANW60
The fact that they're cheering Trump Proves it. https://t.co/YXRHaDg9IE
Trump is running for Captain of the Football team right? https://t.co/bjj2rZUKI9
It may be the end of the world as we know it, but Trump's feeling fine.
@sherifffruitfly If Trump gets elected, we'll probably see an Ayatollah give a sitting president the middle finger for 1st time in history.
@ESPN1000 @CarmenDeFalco @Jurko64 @DitkasPlace Let's hope he won't mention Trump! C'mon man!
@SusanCucinotta @ChuckNellis Agree. But at least he let Ted go 1st. Was Ted's rally, after all. Still same Trump speech, didn't seem to fit.

This man made up my mind to oppose #Brexit when he told Tsipras to hold his head high #betteroffin https://t.co/G4TFuxOMeM
What makes the 3rd bailout different is that, after Tsipras, there will be no one left inside Greece to credibly manage the memorandum
After all these Tsipras headlines, I wonder if they'll still let the Athens Stock Exchange open tomorrow. Will be a total bloodbath.
@NormalCommunity @Ypatia1 Thanks. I reckon Tsipras may be heading for the top three of the world's most disingenuous politicians.
@steve_hanke Tsipras is currently on holidays and on the 6th he is going to Egypt. So i dont think he realizes the situation we are in
Tsipras - "talks are in final stretch" which is Greek for "talks are about to break down and I may call a referendum any minute now"
Fake Greek talks just like fake Iran talks  Tsipras is pulling a Khamenei  https://t.co/gEDf3a33aO
Berlin says Merkel, Tsipras spoke by phone on Tuesday @michellehmartin No details - Why the fishy secrecy? http://t.co/Na234nfBT1
No big deal, Tsipras reminds his admirers all over the world.  If possible, a 2nd emasculation won't be opposed by him.
Trouble ahead for Syriza and Tsipras just as the bailout deal is passed #Greece https://t.co/0t93nMJAxL
@Hugodixon "more moderate" may be! But plenty of uneducated demagogs, who have not done a day's work....Starting  with Tsipras, himself!
It is not about Tsipras, any more. It is about how the 3rd MoU will be implemented. Get over him ... https://t.co/UcpQpK235Z
@pennygeer While the bailout deal was finally agreed, it looks like poor Tsipras, the saviour of his nation, may be the casualty of all this
Keep in mind Tsipras' 1st state visit after elections was Pope Francis in the Vatican. @ma000111 Tsipras an atheist representing Orthodoxy.
Dont  underestimate the power of the pple, don't be sure Tsipras will win, many who voted Syriza the 1st won't now https://t.co/sfaYGW1k4n

Tsipras looks to strengthen his authority after a party mutiny over the 3rd bailout http://t.co/Q1LwVZo0eC http://t.co/xqGo6QdfGo
@worldfacto Tsipras signed the effing 3rd bail-out and now he resigns - shld have resigned before
We may soon see Tsipras campaign for the MoU he doesn't believe in. #Greece
With Tsipras resignaton #Greece will head to the polls for the 6th time in 8 years. via #BBC
Tsipras resigned on Thursday night after he lost the support from within his Syriza party. That is classic #Grexit.
@NickMalkoutzis Hi Nick, might you be available to speak to @lbc on the phone tomorrow about Tsipras? Thanks, Chris

@ComfortablySmug If Trump was Tsipras I'd vote for him. It is true though that he may end up splitting the GOP like Tsipras did the Troika.

If you did not vote UKIP in May then you are a major part of the illegal immigrant problem and no part at all of the solution.....
Roll on September 12th!  The destruction of the Left as an electoral force creates the space for UKIP

LOL Aulas still mad about the penalty Zlatan took a 2nd time a few month ago. I'm delighted by the fact that he is still butt-hurt about it!
We are certainly gonna see Verratti in the 2nd half. I'm like a kid waiting for his present ;-) Oh &amp; Zlatan starts so thats great. #PSGFIO
Zlatan to Milan may not be the best thing for both parties, He will be going to an un settled club, new coach (very tough personality) 1
@Ibra_official Your record of moving to a new country and winning the league is 2nd to none! Man Utd need ZLATAN and ZLATAN needs the EPL..
@ACM_Nicky Till Zlatan comes. He''ll play for PSG in the Super Cup on August 1st, then he's ours.

Friend with connections just offered to let me meet Zlatan &amp; Co. in NJ tomorrow. Alas, my body sucks and I cannot.
So, about Zlatan... I don't want him. All reports are that he's not a good teammate. He'd be our 3rd DP Fwd, how do you work the 3 together?

I have a sneaking feeling we may just see Zlatan in a United shirt soon. Odds slashed from 20/1 to 5/1 ...
French super cup tomorrow... Zlatan's future should be confirmed in the day after that.
@_mindy_ @RetroUnited coz of Zlatan talking how he loves a fight. May make him show LVG just how he is truly world class.
Orun ni zlatan sun niyen smh"@ZIatanFacts: Zlatan once went to a movie, and it watched him for two hours. #ZlatanFacts"

Reserving the right to put Milan 3rd if Zlatan arrives
Zlatan is simply saving himself for the 2nd leg
@DaveEllis11 @klavierstuk but if Zlatan is available for a reasonable fee, it may well be worth going for, for an immediate solution.
@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea. But not enough time rather try for Griezmann. Wont mind Zlatan for a year !
I would love to have cavani man. He's over shawdowed and played 2nd fiddle to Zlatan he would shine at arsenal
Zlatan wears sunglasses so his eyes do not harm the sun.
@Keith_Russell I don't want it to be but it may be Austin. Obviously prefer Zlatan, muller, Lewandowski etc #mufc
We held talks with PSG on Thursday for Zlatan name now confirmed to me but this is two days old news
@rhysllew26 I reckon we'll get him next season! Zlatan for this year! Get the swagger in! You going tomorrow?
Zlatan is looking mighty attractive at the moment,if LVG doesn't get a striker by Tuesday, I really don't fancy us scoring goals this season
Wonder if Zlatan will be a United player come Tuesday night, think he may be the only realistic option of a big name signing.
Ok ed let's do this, Zlatan, greizmann and Laporte tomorrow make it happen
Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC

@ChampionsLeague @FCBarcelona barca will successfully defended the title, with the arda and aleix in January plus MSN I don't see them lose.
He was in the Atletico academy, Real is the biggest team in Europe next to Barca. All his friends are in Madrid. LOL https://t.co/AiCHWLTiU8
@AnderJuanderful when managers/players make it a matter of their ego then things always go bad. That's his problem.. 2nd stint at Barca e.g
@jamiepowell07 its the dogs, ye its amazing and defo go to a barca game, the 1st footie game ive enjoyed in years
Then everton will get the player from Barca on loan :) https://t.co/n1vOyCdFiy

@Hayles_101 the chap is in his 2nd season of a 3 year deal. He has done the business at barca and Munich and I'm sure he will do it for us.
@christhomas1190 he'll be ready in January for Barca!!
@andrewmperry the thing though is if pogba ever does leave juve it will be to barca, also my team isn't in 13th place right now.
Can't wait for Arda to play with Barca, January na pls! https://t.co/RWRRFgDnf0
@Oo_Gho_Gho So Neymar being fifth and Eden being 6th shows nothing other than Barca did better than chelsea in the CL.
@Kayboy_007 he should walk straight to barca's 1st team.
Slowly getting my last bits pulled together for Barca! Gonna get everything finalised today so I can just relax tomorrow :)
@FFC_JM @adidasUK may all the power of Barca and Messi be with you this season!
Neymar shockingly starts playing for Brazil like he does for Barca https://t.co/RSuKe3s16i
@EhabIbrahim77 Man Utd are a bigger club than everyone besides Real and Barca. They may be at the top of their game by the time he peaks

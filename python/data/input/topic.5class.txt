641431997152411650	serena	1	I'm pretty sure Serena ripped that match winning ace the same time USMNT game up their 3rd.
641432027129061376	serena	1	And with Serena's 11th ace she wins the match vs her sister Venus

637698794075877376	barca	0	We now just need less than 4.5 goals in the Barca match and Real match to land the 32/1 7-fold. I may cover our bet before the last match
637705438100746240	barca	1	Let's go Barca 1 goal before the 1st half ends.
637707030183022592	barca	0	I hope that Barca does a lot more better in the 2nd half then in the 1st half.
637710595324801024	barca	1	@fcbarcelona surprise, surprise! Barca has the upperhand, but it seems Malaga has their 12th man, the ref is so bias. #CampNou #FCBMalaga
637712084248035328	barca	1	I honestly think what we're seeing with Fabregas is really him and why Barca were quick to part ways. Last August-November was a one-off
637714760973201408	barca	1	Soccer Saturday! Watching Barca with my nerd right now and then going to see the Armada tonight!
637739887010025472	barca	1	Vermaelen the hero for Barca: Thomas Vermaelen was the unlikely hero as Barcelona laboured to a 1-0 home win over Malaga on Saturday ...
637752769621938176	barca	0	@ChampionsLeague @realmadriden @FCBarcelona @LigaBBVA Barca may have more points but Real Madrid play the better football
637754515295375360	barca	1	#Barca Did Florentino Perez make the schedule in La Liga? Barca's 1st 4 away games all against top 8 teams; RM plays Sevilla &amp; 3 creampuffs.
637764275944181760	barca	1	@jodynotjodie Same. Knackered. I'm going into town tomorrow to watch it. Probably go Barca on the locks. Where you watching it?!
637779994840854528	barca	1	Pedro sat bench for Barca &amp; KDB wins POTY in Germany but yet Pedro is the "better" player.
637863941666942976	barca	0	Barca on the other hand could have problems. Must avoid injuries and stay in touch til Jan and probably add 2 more on top of Arda an Vidal
637909992880926720	barca	1	@BenUFO hey ben really enjoyed your set in barca last night, what was the 2nd last track you played? sounded like caribou?
637942532735934464	barca	1	had great time in Barca, also made some profit which is always nice. Back to the online grind for the sunday today #vamoooos #lfg
637976485538725888	barca	1	Return of Sunday morning watching the lad play footy. All week I picture them playing like Barca, the reality is very different. #YouthFooty
638047894503821312	barca	1	@ASR_Nick This is the Roma I wanna see vs Barca in Rome on the 16th. The match will be epic.
638074401171349505	barca	0	@OldTraffordReds I look at his past record 2 n it's awful nearly got barca relegated nearly finished 5th wif bayern b4 he got sacked
638102785536466945	barca	0	@THT1878 @Blueboybaz @Andy_H_EFC what chance Nolito ?? Or is he off to Barca in Jan ?
638305772334657536	barca	1	Done my balls in Barca but still treated myself to a five euro 1st class upgrade on the fast train to Madrid. #BudgetBaller
638378366484258816	barca	1	@Mattyy_Official It solves part of the problem but the jigsaw still has some big gaps that need addressing by 6pm tomorrow! Enjoy Barca!
638379286672486400	barca	1	For football fans, it's transfer deadline day. For us, barca fans, its just another Monday :v
638385619002126336	barca	0	@RafaelH117 @DianaKristinne  do you guys think if Barca reaches January as leaders they can win the League and whether team can achieve that
638448857463037952	barca	0	@lewis59453181 yer some Argentinian kid from Barca is flying in tomorrow, apparently Traore has told him it's good at villa.
638473308988571649	barca	0	@_suprene @sinTripas_ if he can play then I hope he plays against barca, on the 20th
638478279633059840	barca	0	So De Gea will be just like the Barca situation, can't play but is basically at the club because he should leave when January comes
638483270355812352	barca	0	If DDG is stuck here till Jan, can we offer him to Barca just to annoy Madrid even more.
638483514850193408	barca	0	Madrid and Barca run the La Liga, not a chance DDG won't be a Madrid player by tomorrow.
638488377340223489	barca	0	Of course it will be, When Barca can sign a player inspite being banned from signing, Why not Real get 1 minute. https://t.co/c6kXXMyfFb
638495933681020928	barca	0	Can we just really piss Madrid off and sell De Gea to Barca in January
638501075910324224	barca	0	@cottonballfc very true I wish they would accept but I think we have a shot to get him in January and fight Barca for him what do you think?
638599370590527488	barca	1	@halamufc @swagattt @joelsimondsouza Personally I think Utd should just tell Madrid, the deal is gone and then in January sell DDG to Barca
638637717509799936	barca	0	Barca fans when they saw "UEFA will study the case tomorrow. They will make a decision on the De Gea case" http://t.co/BmV0wbjeoy
638641315719286784	barca	2	@ChampionsLeague @FCBarcelona barca will successfully defended the title, with the arda and aleix in January plus MSN I don't see them lose.
638657552495038464	barca	0	@tigeramer10 @SergeMUFC .. Which they won't do as they are facing a transfer ban akin to Barca. Even De Gea going January misses the CL.
638661416422129664	barca	1	He was in the Atletico academy, Real is the biggest team in Europe next to Barca. All his friends are in Madrid. LOL https://t.co/AiCHWLTiU8
638680730160115712	barca	-1	@AnderJuanderful when managers/players make it a matter of their ego then things always go bad. That's his problem.. 2nd stint at Barca e.g
638766156552249344	barca	0	@The__Fundraiser Barca turned down the opportunity and experimented with Suarez. Bayern haven't opened a cheque yet[Have 1st preference]
638811135316242432	barca	1	@jamiepowell07 its the dogs, ye its amazing and defo go to a barca game, the 1st footie game ive enjoyed in years
638817591385980928	barca	0	Ben Lederman may well end up being the first American to play for Barca but, for the time being, it sounds like he's heading to Florida.
638982574631579649	barca	1	Then everton will get the player from Barca on loan :) https://t.co/n1vOyCdFiy
638987354703855616	barca	1	@bluekippercom @edmunddafox he's off to barca in January
639032600586289152	barca	1	@Guinnessvip Equally he's d 2nd most expensive under21s(after Neymar's Barca move)&amp;3rd most expensive signing in ManU's history #MadeOfBlack
639041704436305921	barca	0	Atletico Madrid is going to be dangerous..Pedro leaving is going to hurt Barca in the long run..no bench to rest MSN https://t.co/TD02TABov8

639429903855788032	barca	0	Can only mean one thing: he is joining Barca - probably in January.
639533397921165312	barca	0	@FCBMJohnKJ psg could be the 2nd best team in the world behind Barcelona but they always get Barca lol, so we would never know

640319900343398400	barca	1	@tfaheel haha no, the first was just Barca and then I put the "|" just to separate for my 2nd club
640379349368070144	barca	1	@hotcheetos4 still got smacked by Barca. Wolfsburg went far in the Europa and BVB lost to finalists. EPL is 3rd.

640576800071000064	barca	1	@christhomas1190 he'll be ready in January for Barca!!
640580666040520704	barca	1	@andrewmperry the thing though is if pogba ever does leave juve it will be to barca, also my team isn't in 13th place right now.
640666824774782976	barca	1	Can't wait for Arda to play with Barca, January na pls! https://t.co/RWRRFgDnf0
640830613109534722	barca	1	@Oo_Gho_Gho So Neymar being fifth and Eden being 6th shows nothing other than Barca did better than chelsea in the CL.
640857616730615808	barca	0	We are not Real Barca or Bayern that players would be ready to join the club as a 2nd/ 3rd choice. On what grounds would you bench Coq/Santi
640859852655431680	barca	1	@Kayboy_007 he should walk straight to barca's 1st team.
640897834418618368	barca	1	Slowly getting my last bits pulled together for Barca! Gonna get everything finalised today so I can just relax tomorrow :)

641469594247413761	barca	0	I hated Tata Martino in Barca and I can't stand him coaching Argentina! Even though it's a friendly no reason to play 5 defenders in 1st 45
641518637707325440	barca	1	@EhabIbrahim77 Man Utd are a bigger club than everyone besides Real and Barca. They may be at the top of their game by the time he peaks
641562317528809476	barca	1	@MoeAnabtawi Barca is the best team not Real .. no one can win over it ... and see u on Sat ;)

636936698144821248	federer	1	@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
637082749875134464	federer	1	All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
637492541969928192	federer	1	@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!

639424209945501696	federer	1	Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
639574179172454400	federer	1	Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss.
639589478638743552	federer	1	Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading.
639599584252166144	federer	1	Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!
639704216920027136	federer	1	Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match! Woah!

640149748763217920	federer	0	Fognini is I believe only the 3rd one to beat Nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others (no points for guessing) Federer and Djokovic.
640210392829042688	federer	1	Most Masters 1000 titles (27) 2nd most Grand Slam titles (24 tied with Sampras after Federer's 17)

640270623516717056	federer	0	Federer's next match is going to be the 1st obstacle he faces on his way to the finals. His first serve needs to be on point against Isner.
640360671054557184	federer	0	Survey: Federer has ostensibly the toughest 4th round match, but is there a tougher one? Does Isner win a set? Does RBA?

641066878375493633	federer	1	Federer's second serve placement is awesome. That's why he's the best server ever. Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve

641085537973997568	federer	2	Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
641085618169245700	federer	2	Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. Leads Isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen
641087405353779200	federer	1	I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
641088714014347264	federer	1	I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
641089660849127424	federer	1	That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el
641094016289914880	federer	1	Wow, Federer wastes 3 bps with 3 Isner's 2nd serves. Fed 0/8 on bps tonight

641097789565353985	federer	-1	i out of 11 breakpts converted-not nearly good enough by Federer at #USOpen2015 . C'mon, Deliciano, you can beat Novak- Believe !
641099162243698688	federer	0	Disappointing end to the match for Isner. Would've liked to see a 3rd set tiebreak but Federer is a robot. He's ridiculous.
641110299576258561	federer	1	@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak
